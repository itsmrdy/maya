/// An abstract class that defines the contract for seeding data.
///
/// The [Seeder] class serves as a base class for any data seeding operations in the application. 
/// Any class that extends [Seeder] is required to implement the [run] method, which is responsible 
/// for populating a data source (such as a database or an in-memory list) with initial or sample data.
///
/// This class provides a standardized way to define data seeding logic, ensuring that different parts 
/// of the application can seed their data in a consistent manner.
///
/// Example of a subclass:
/// ```dart
/// class UserSeeder extends Seeder {
///   @override
///   Future<void> run() async {
///     // Logic for seeding user data
///   }
/// }
/// ```
abstract class Seeder {
  /// The method that subclasses must implement to perform data seeding operations.
  ///
  /// This method should contain the logic for populating the data source with initial data.
  /// It is typically called during the application setup or testing phase to populate 
  /// the database or in-memory storage with predefined data.
  ///
  /// The method is asynchronous, allowing for database operations or other IO-bound tasks 
  /// to complete before finishing the seeding process.
  Future<void> run();
